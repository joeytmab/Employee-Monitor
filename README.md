<h1 align="center">Employee Monitor (MKII)</h1>

## Description

Primary technologies used: NODE.JS, MySQL, and INQUIRER.

Employee Monitor is an application that allows user interaction with information stored in a MySQL-created database. This is a prime example of a "CMS", or Content Management System.

The app is dynamically designed for business/company owners looking to manufacture a digital database structured around employee, job role, and job department parameters.

## Installation Parameters

`npm i` is necessary for proper function of the app.

In the event that initial packages do not suffice and the application cannot function, `npm i mysql2 util inquirer` can help manually install the MySQL, Util, and Inquirer packages.

`npm i console.table asciiart-logo` is a command also included to download Console.Table and ASCIIArt-Logo packages. These are not necessary for functionality and only help with aesthetic augmentation of the app.

Once completed, run the command `node index.js` to open the question prompts and begin creation, viewing, and formatting of the database.
